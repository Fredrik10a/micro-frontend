# Microfrontend Basic Setup (ReactJS)

🚀 Welcome to the MicroFrontend basic setup repository! This showcase guides you through establishing a MicroFrontend architecture using Webpack 5 and SingleSPA in two distinct projects. As of today, only "webpack5" operates as intended, so please refer to the README inside each project folder for specific instructions.

I'm enthusiastic about receiving your feedback and suggestions to enhance the cleanliness and efficiency of these projects. The goal is to maintain simplicity while ensuring practical applicability in real-life scenarios.
