# Microfrontend Basic Setup (ReactJS)

🚀 **Welcome to the MicroFrontend Basic Setup repository!** This showcase guides you through establishing a MicroFrontend architecture using Webpack 5 and SingleSPA in two distinct projects. As of today, only "webpack5" operates as intended, so please refer to the README inside each project folder for specific instructions.

I would greatly appreciate your feedback and suggestions as I explore and learn new technologies through this test implementation. Your insights will not only enhance the cleanliness and efficiency of these projects but also contribute to creating valuable knowledge that can be shared with others on the same learning journey.

## Reference Documentation 📖
